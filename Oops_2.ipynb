    "Q1.Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "Ans- Python provides inbuilt functions for creating,writing, and reading files. There are two types of files that can be handled in Python, normal text file and binary files (written in\n",
    "     binary language, Os, and 1s).\n",
    "     Text files: In this type of file, each line of text is terminated with a special character called EOL (End of Line), which is the new line character ('\\n') in Python by default. In \n",
    "     the case of CSV(Comma Seperated Files, the EOF is a comma by default.\n",
    "     Binary files: In this type of file, there is no terminator for a line, and the data is stored after converting it into machine- understandable binary language, i.e., 0 and 1 formate.\n",
    "                     \n",
    "      Different modes of opening a file-\n",
    "     'r' - Open text file for reading. Raises an I\\O error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "     'r+'- Open the file for reading and writing. Raises an I\\O error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "     'w' - Open the file for writing. Truncates the file if it already exists. Creates a new file if it already exists. \n",
    "     'w+'- Open the file for reading and writing. Truncates the file if it already exists. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "     'a' - Open the file for writing. The data will being written will be inserted at the end of the file. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "     'a+'- Open the file for reading and writing. The data being written will be inserted at the end of the file. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",

    "     'wb+'-Open the file for reading and writing in binary formate. Truncates the file if it already exists. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
